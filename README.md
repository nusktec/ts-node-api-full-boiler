# Node.js Backend Starter (TypeScript + Docker)

## 🚀 Node.js + TypeScript Boilerplate
**by [rdx-codes]**

This boilerplate is a powerful starting point for building robust and scalable backend services using **Node.js** and **TypeScript**. Created to ease repetitive setup processes, it comes fully equipped with modern backend essentials — so you can focus on building features, not scaffolding.

- **☁️ AWS S3 Support** – Easily upload and manage files using AWS S3 or any compatible provider.
- **🔗 Multiple Database Support**:

    - **MongoDB** with Mongoose for document-based storage.
    - **Redis** for caching, session management, and pub/sub messaging.
